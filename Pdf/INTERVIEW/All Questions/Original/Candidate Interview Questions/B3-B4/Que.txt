1) input:- l = [2,3,[5,6,[6,7]],6,7]
output:- [2,3,5,6,6,7,6,7]
2)# Write a function Sort the list without using sort()
# Input : [6,5,2,1,3,2,1,4,7,2]
# Output :  [1,1,2,2,2,3,4,5,6,7]
3)# Write a function to Reverse string:
#             Input : “text1 text2 text3”
# Output: “text3 text2 text1”
4)Most frequently occured elemen (by using for, no other method or in build function) l = [4,5,6,7,3,4,6,8] and program should be dynamic.
5) write a function where i want to multiply 2 numbers, where the no's are 1 and 2    ->( mul(1,2)  o/p=2)
without changing the main function and arguments,i want output 12    (10*1+2 = 12), (use decorator function).
6) input :- l1=[3,4,5,6,7], l2=[1,2,7,8,3]
output:- [(3,1), (4,2),(5,7),(6,8),(7,3)]   without using zip().
