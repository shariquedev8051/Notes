# GitHub

## Accessing remote repository
1. **`git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/repositoryname.git`**:- add origin.
1. **`git remote -v`**:- To show you that Origin has been added.

## Cloning repository from GitHub
1. **`git clone "repository url"`**

## Signing in using SSH key
1. [Help is here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

## Pull command 
1. **git pull origin master**

## Fork command
1. [fork pull request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3bjQX9jIBk)

## Push command 
1. **`git push -u origin master`** :- Push git directory into GitHub.
1. **`git push -d origin branchname`**:- To delete remote GitHub directory.

# Bitbucket 

1. Add name whatever you need for e.g upload

   ```
   $ git remote add upload <link_gitbucket>
   ```

   

# How to configure multiple remote repsository

For example 

```python
$ git remote add origin repository_name(github)
```

so we have add GitHub repository with name **origin**.

```git
$ git remote add upload repository_name(bitbucket)
```

git won't allow push before pull

```
$ git pull upload <branch_name> --allow-unrelated-histories
```

if you get histories related error then type this

And bitbucket repository with name **upload**.

```git
$ git push origin master
```

 will push master branch to **GitHub**

```git
$ git push upload master
```

and will push code to bitbucket

using alias 

```git
$ alias gpob="git push origin master && git push bitbucket master"
```

or you can do this also

```
$ cd myproject
$ git remote set-url --add origin ssh://git@bitbucket.org/user/myproject.git
$ git push origin master
Everything up-to-date
Everything up-to-date
```



You can not use **pull all** command in git...



# Adding .gitignore

1. **`*.log`**:- Ignore all file having extension of.log .  
1. **`dir/`**:- Ignore content of a folder and its sub folder.  
1. **!log.log** :- will note be ignored as it has negation operator "!".

## Some useful Linux commands:
1. **`q`** :- To quit Linux , like ctrl+c.
2. **`pwd`** :- present working directory
3. **`ls`** :- lists all file in directory
4. **`cd`**:- change directory
5. **`touch file_name`** :- To create a file using Linux .
6.  - **`vim file_name`**:- open it in vim editor
    - press **i** to edit the contents.
    - hit : and then wq to quit the vim.
6. **Shit+insert** to past in gitbash
8. **ctrl + '+'** for zoom in and **ctrl + '-'**  vice versa


Some tips:
1. If you rename the file in the same directory. Git will consider it as it was deleted.

2. Never write in commit message "changed dir" or "modified file" commit means you have changed something.

3. Don't write date and time also...


# Errors

   #### <span style = "color:red"> Error :1 </span>

  when try to push file **Local repository** into **GitHub repository**

   ![](D:\Note in pdf\Mark down\Python Programming\error1.png)

solution :

We have to rebase the repository type following code in gitbash

````powershell
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
````

FYI default branch name of **GitHub** is **main ** so if you use type **`git push origin master`** in **gitbash** than you are pushing master branch in **GitHub** repository ..

This error occurred because I renamed my main branch to master. But it will not create an extra branch.
