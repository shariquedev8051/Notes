# Dua it is only way

## For distress

### **1. Dua in times of distress**

​	Asma' Binti 'Umais r.a narrated that  "Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. said to me: Shall I not teach you some words to say when in distress? 

```
اللهُ اللهُ ربِّي لَا أُشرِكُ به شيئًا

*Allah, Allah, Rabbi La Ushriku Bihi Syai'a*
```

"Allah, Allah, my Lord, I do not associate anything with Him"

### **2. Dua of Prophet Yunus a.s.**

When stranded in the belly of a whale, isolated from even the slightest glimpse of light and as  though the way out seems impossible, Prophet Yunus a.s. placed his hope  and reliance upon Allah s.w.t. and recited the following invocations:

```
لاَّ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ

 *La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu minaz zalimin*
```

“There is no god but You, exalted are You! Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers.”

(Surah Al Anbiya, 21:87)

### **3. Dua for seeking refuge from severe calamity, misery, and to be freed from misfortune**

```
اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ جَهْدِ الْبَلَاءِ، وَدَرَكِ الشَّقَاءِ، وَسُوءِ الْقَضَاءِ، وَشَمَاتَةِ الْأَعْدَاءِ

*Allahumma inni a’uzu bika min jahdil-bala’, wa darki shaqa’, wa su’il-qadha’, wa shamatatil-a’da’*
```

"O Allah, I seek refuge in You from severe calamity, from misery to fall upon me,  from misfortune in the decree, and from the joys of the enemies."

(Sahih Al-Bukhari)

### **4. Dua to attain calmness of the heart from being anxious**

```
رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِي صَدْرِي وَيَسِّرْ لِي أَمْرِي وَاحْلُلْ عُقْدَةً مِّن لِّسَانِي يَفْقَهُوا قَوْلِي

*Rabbi-shrah li sodri, wa yassir li amri, wahlul uqdatan min lisani yafqohu qawli*
```

"Lord, lift up my heart and ease my task for me. Remove the impediment from my tongue so that they may understand my speech."

(Surah Taha, 20:25-28)

### **5. Dua for attaining confidence in Allah s.w.t.**

```
رَبَّنَا عَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ أَنَبْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ

*Robbana, ‘alaika tawakkalna, wa ilaika anabna, wa ilaikal-masir*
```

"Our Lord! In You we have placed our trust, and to You we turn in repentance, and to You is the final return."

(Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:4)

### **6. Dua for hardship and distress**

Allah s.w.t. will grant  whoever recites this 7 times in the morning or evening sufficiency from  which whatever matters that brings him or her grief:

```
حَسْبِيَ اللَّهُ لآ إلَهَ إلَّا هُوَ، عَلَيْهَ توَكَّلتُ، وَهُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ

*HasbiyAllahu la illaha illa Huwa, ‘alayhi tawakkaltu, wa Huwa Rabbul arshil azim*
```

"Allah is  sufficient for me. There is none worthy of worship but Him. I have  placed my trust in Him, and He is the lord of the Majestic Throne."

(Sunan Abi Daud)

Allah is with you wherever you are,  Insya’Allah. Seek the proper help you need, beyond invoking these  prayers. Mental wellbeing is important and we have a duty to take care  of it. Seeking professional medical intervention and support is  essential and indeed part of our endeavour (*ikhtiyar*) in getting ourselves better. 

May Allah ease your worries, fears and anxiety and grant you calmness, peace and healing. Ameen.
