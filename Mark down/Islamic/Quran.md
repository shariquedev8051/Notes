## Introduction

***In the Name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful***

The importance of reciting, studying and contemplating on the verses  of the Holy Qur’an cannot be stressed enough. Indeed this great  revelation has many depths and mysteries that have yet to be discovered. Those who frequently read the Holy Qur’an can attest to the fact that  it is an unending source of information and a bottomless well of fresh  knowledge and guidance. Reading it repeatedly does not lead to ennui,  but rather causes one to open many more avenues of thought.

How unfortunate is the person who forsakes the words of his Creator?  And what excuse would be acceptable for doing so? If the true value of  the Holy Qur’an was understood, the Muslims of the world would not be  where they are today. Lifetimes can be spent in research about the  meanings of what is contained in this divine book and yet nothing would  be exhausted from it.

Yet this great living miracle lies abandoned in our libraries,  bookshelves, or even in a beautifully created casing; gathering dust  from lack of use. All this while we digress in all spheres of our lives. This is why when we will be brought to account for our deeds and  misdeeds on the Day of Judgment, we will have no reason to say that we  were not adequately guided, because we are the ones who did not take the readily available guidance.

At this point it should be mentioned that one cannot interpret the  verses of the Holy Qur’an using their own logical deductions or  reasoning. If we were to do this then we would easily stray from the  correct path and would begin to justify our fallacies with our own  interpretations of this divine text. Many traditions have been narrated  about this and grave punishments have been promised to those who misuse  the Holy Qur’an for personal gain.

The *Tafsir* or interpretation of the Holy Qur’an is actually  done very carefully by very learned religious scholars who refer to vast amounts of historical texts and traditions of the Holy Prophet (S.) and the *Aimmah* (a.s). Fortunately, many *Tafasir* are readily available today and one can easily find the interpretations of any particular verse of the Holy Qur’an.

It should be noted, however, that aside from the benefits of guidance towards divine truth, the verses and chapters of the Holy Qur’an also  have a hidden benefit. In fact, there is so much benefit in the  recitation of some portions of this great book, that it would surprise  us. 

This is the aspect of the Holy Qur’an that we wish to discuss in the  following pages. Hopefully, it will be a way of encouraging people to  frequently recite the Holy Qur’an and take advantage of its numerous  benefits. We pray to Allah (S.w.T.) to enlist us from those who always  recite the Holy Qur’an when He raises us on the Day of Judgement –  Ameen.

# Benefits of the recitation of the chapters of the Holy Qur’an

## [The Verse “Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim”](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#verse-bismillahir-rahmanir-rahim)

If we were to give an exhaustive account of the benefits of the  recitation of “Bismillah…” we would need more than a single volume to do justice to it. Apart from being part of every chapter in the Holy  Qur’an (except the chapter of repentance [*Surah at-tawba]*), it is also the most oft repeated verse in the Holy Qur’an.

It is narrated in *Tafsir al-Burhaan* that the Holy Prophet  (S) has said that when a person recites “Bismillah...” then five  thousand ruby palaces are built for him in *Jannah* Each palace  has a thousand chambers made of pearls and in each chamber has seventy  thousand thrones of emerald and each throne has seventy thousand carpets made from special fabrics and upon each carpet is seated a *Hur-ul-Ein*. A person asked for the condition necessary to get this great reward and the Holy Prophet (S) replied that the person should recite the  “Bismillah…” with conviction and understanding.

The Holy Prophet (S) has also said that when a believer will have to cross the *Pul-e-Siraat* on the Day of Judgement, and he will say “Bismillah…” then the flames beneath him will start dying down until *Jahannam* will cry out, ‘O believer, pass through quickly, your presence is causing my fire to die out !’

When a teacher teaches a child to recite “Bismillah…” the child, his  parents and the teacher are all guaranteed freedom from hellfire. It is  narrated that Prophet Isa (a.s.) was once passing by a graveyard and he  saw a grave upon which the Wrath and Punishment of Allah (S.w.T.) was  descending, so he quietly walked past. When he passed the same place  after some time, he noticed that the Mercy and Blessings of Allah  (S.w.T.) was being showered on the same grave. He was surprised at this  and asked Allah (S.w.T.) about what has happened and it was revealed to  him that the man inside the grave was a sinner and was thus being  punished for his sins. When he died, his wife was pregnant and soon gave birth to a son. When the boy grew older, his mother took him to a  teacher who taught him to recite “Bismillah…” and I felt that it would  not be justice that this man’s son was calling My Name and I was  punishing his father in the grave.

It is also mentioned that recitation of “Bismillah…” with a loud  voice is from the signs of a true believer. Imam Ali Ridha (a.s.) said  that “Bismillah…” is very close to the chosen name of Allah (S.w.T.) *[Isma A’adham].*

## [Surah al-Fatihah (The Opening)](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-al-fatihah-opening)

There are seven verses in this Surah (chapter) and it is said that this Surah is both *‘makki’* and *‘madani’* ie. it was revealed in both Makkah and Madinah. 

In the commentary of *Majma’ul Bayan* it is narrated that the  Holy Prophet (S) said that whoever recites this Surah, he will get the  reward for reciting two thirds (2/3) of the whole Qur’an, and will get  the reward equivalent to what would be gained by giving charity to all  the believing men and women in the world.

One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (S) narrates that he once  recited this Surah in the presence of the Holy Prophet (S) and the  Prophet said, ‘By Him in whose hand is my soul, a similar revelation to  this has not been included in the *Taurat* (Torah)*, Injeel* (Bible)*, Zabur* (Psalms) or even the Qur’an itself.’

The Holy Prophet (S) once asked Jabir ibn Abdallah Ansari, “Should I  teach you a Surah that has no other comparison to it in the whole Qur’an ?” Jabir replied, “Yes, and may my parents be ransom upon you O prophet of Allah.” So the Holy Prophet (S) taught him Surah al-Fatihah. Then  the Holy Prophet (S) asked, “Jabir, should I tell you something about  this Surah ?” Jabir answered, “Yes, and may my parents be ransom upon  you O prophet of Allah.” The Prophet (S) said, “It (Surah al-Fatihah) is a cure for every ailment except death.”

Imam AbuAbdillah Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that whoever cannot  be cured by Surah al-Fatihah, then there is no cure for that person. In  the same narration it is written that if this Surah is recited 70 times  on any part of the body that is paining, the pain will surely go away.  In fact, the power of this Surah is so great that it is said that if one were to recite it 70 times over a dead body, you should not become  surprised if that body starts moving (ie. comes back to life).

Surah al-Fatihah is a cure for physical and also spiritual ailments.  Without this Surah, even the daily prayers are incomplete. It is indeed a great treasure that has been given to us by Allah (S.w.T.) through the  Holy Prophet (S) and no previous prophet has been given anything like  it. This Surah is also known as *‘Ummul Kitab’* and *‘Sab’a mathani’.*

## [Surah al-Baqarah (The Cow)](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-al-baqarah-cow)

This Surah has 286 verses and is a *‘madani’* Surah ie. it was revealed in Madinah. It is also the longest Surah in the Holy Qur’an.

The Holy Prophet (S) has said that whoever recites the first four verses of Surah al-Baqarah, accompanied by the *‘ayatul kursi’* together with the last three verses of this Surah - and makes a habit  of reciting these verses daily – his life, property and family will be  protected and no evil shall come upon them. *Shaitan* will not come close to him and he will not be from those who forget Allah (S.w.T.).

## [Surah Ali-’Imran (The Family of Imran)](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-ali-imran-family-imran)

In this Surah, there are a total of 200 verses and it was revealed in Madinah. The Holy Prophet (S) has said that whoever recites Surah  Ali-’Imran on Friday, then until the setting of the sun, he will be  showered by the Mercy of Allah (S.w.T.) and the angels will beg for his  forgiveness.

The Prophet (S) has also recommended this Surah for those women who are not able to conceive. The Surah should be written using *saffron* and then given to her to wear as a talisman and by the Will of Allah (S.w.T.) she will conceive.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that if a person faces hardship  in earning his livelihood, he should write this Surah and wear it as a  talisman and Allah (S.w.T.) will increase his sustenance greatly. The  Imam (a.s.) also said that if anyone recites both Surah al-Baqarah and  Ali-’Imran, then these Surahs will come in the shape of clouds on the  day of judgement to protect him from the scorching heat.

## [Surah an-Nisa (The Women)](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-nisa-women)

## [Surah al-Ma’idah (The Table-spread)](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-al-maidah-table-spread)

There are 120 verses in this Surah and it is a *‘makki’* Surah ie. it was revealed in Makkah. It is narrated from the Holy Prophet (S) that whoever recites this Surah, he will get a reward equivalent to ten times the number of Jews and Christians alive in the world, and will be forgiven the same amount of sins and will be raised in status by the  same amount.

## [Surah al-An’aam (The Cattle)](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-al-anaam-cattle)

This Surah was revealed in Makkah and contains a total of 165 verses. Imam Ridha (a.s.) has said that this Surah was revealed accompanied by  the descending of seventy thousand angels. These angels will ask  forgiveness from Allah (S.w.T.) for any person who recites this Surah,  and they will continue doing so until the Day of Judgement.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that if a person writes this Surah using musk or *saffron* and then drinks it (ie. puts the written Surah in water for its writing to dissolve) for six consecutive days, that person will be blessed  abundantly and will be free from all problems and ailments. He will not  loose his health or fall sick.

The 6th Holy Imam (a.s.) also said that this Surah must be accorded  due respect as the name of Allah (S.w.T.) appears 70 times in it. If  people knew the benefits of reciting this Surah, they would never leave  it.

## [Surah al-A’araaf (The Elevated Places)](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-al-aaraaf-elevated-places)

There are 206 verses in this *‘makki’* Surah. It is reported  from Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.), that whoever recites this Surah once a month, he will have no worry or fear on the Day of Resurrection and if  it is recited on a Friday, then the reciter will be from among those who will be exempted from the taking of accounts on the Day of Judgement.

Surah al-A’araaf has the *ayaat al-muhkamaat* that will give  witness on behalf of its reciter on the Day of Reckoning. The Holy  Prophet (S) has said that there will be a veil between the reciter of  this Surah and *Iblees* on Judgement day and the reciter will be in the company of Prophet Adam (a.s.)

Writing this Surah with rose water and *saffron* and keeping the writing at all times ensures safety from enemies and wild animals.

## [Surah al-Anfaal (The Spoils of War)](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-al-anfaal-spoils-war)

This Surah was revealed in Madinah and it has 75 verses. In the commentary of *Majma’ul Bayaan,* it is narrated from Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) that whoever recites Surah al-Anfaal and Surah at-Tawba every month, he will be protected from  being a hypocrite and will be counted among the followers of Ameerul  Mu’mineen – Imam Ali (a.s.), and on the day of *Qiyamah* he will eat from the table-spread of *Jannah* together with all the followers of *Ahlul Bayt.*

This Surah contains the verse about *khums, which* is the right of the *Ahlul Bayt*. The Holy Prophet (S.) said that he will, on the Day of Judgement,  intercede for the person who recites this Surah and will bear witness  that the reciter of this Surah was free from hypocrisy. Keeping Surah  al-Anfaal in your possession at all times ensures that you get your  rights that have been taken from you and your legitimate desires are  fulfilled.

## [Surah al-Bara’at - at-Tawba (The Repentance)](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-al-baraat-tawba-repentance)

It is narrated that keeping this Surah over one’s head  (like in a cap or *Amama*) is a safety from thieves and  destruction of property by fire. Also, keeping this Surah in one’s  possession ensures safety from the evil designs of enemies.

It is also narrated that if a person  recites Surah Yunus, he will get the reward equal to the number of  people who were present in the community of Prophet Yunus (a.s.).

This Surah can be used as a means of identifying thieves from among  your workers. This is done by either writing the Surah and under it  writing the names of all the people in the house or workplace who could  be suspected of stealing and then keeping this writing in the house. It  will, after some time, become manifest who the thief is.

## [Surah Hud](https://www.al-islam.org/fawaid-e-quran-sayyid-mustafa-musawi/benefits-recitation-chapters-holy-quran#surah-hud)

It is narrated from the Holy Prophet (S.) that the person who recites Surah Hud will get a reward equal to the number of people who were  there at the time of the Holy Prophet (S) and his rank will be like of  the martyrs. The accounting for his deeds will also be made easy for  him.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that writing this Surah on a  sheepskin and keeping it in one’s possession at all times makes one so  courageous and bold that nobody can defeat him in combat. Whoever sees  him will be filled with fear.

It has been narrated from Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq that whoever recited this Surah daily, he will be raised on the day of *Qiyamah* with the handsomeness of Prophet Yusuf (a.s.) and he will be protected from  the fear and discomfort of this day. He will be raised among the pious  servants of Allah (S.w.T.). This Surah also keeps one’s heart safe from  illegitimate lustful desires.

The sixth Imam (a.s.) has also said that if a person drinks the water in which this Surah has been dissolved, then his sustenance will be  easier to reach and he will be made from the people of *Jannah.*

There are 43 *ayaat* in this Surah and it is *‘makki’* though some *Mufassireen* (those who have written commentaries of the Holy Qur’an) say that the last  verse of this Surah was revealed in Madinah. In fact, some even go as  far as saying that the whole of this Surah is *‘madani’* except for two verses.

The Holy Prophet (a.s.) has been quoted as saying that whoever  recites this Surah will be made from among those who fulfil their  promise to Allah (S.w.T.) and they will be given reward which is ten  times the number of sins they have committed.

It is narrated that Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that if a *mu’min* recites this Surah often, he will be taken to *Jannah* without having to give the long and detailed accounts for his deeds on Earth.  He will also be allowed to intercede on behalf of his relatives and  friends.

If this Surah is written at night, after the time for *Isha*  prayers, under a candle’s light, and then hung outside the door of a  tyrant ruler’s palace, then the ruler will perish and so will his  control over the people. His army and his supporters will betray him and nobody will listen to him.

If written and tied on one’s arm, it makes any business conducted by  the wearer to be profitable and makes people like doing business with  him. His sustenance thus increases. In a narration by Imam Ja’far  as-Sadiq (a.s.) one can also put this Surah (written) inside the pocket  or safe (for storing valuables).

In the commentary of *Majma’ul Bayan* it is recorded from the Holy Prophet (S) that whoever recites this  Surah will not be questioned, on the Day of Judgement, about the  blessings he received on the Earth and will get the reward equal to the  amount of people who left a good will when they died.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that whoever recites Surah  an-Nahl once every month, he will be safe from 70 types of diseases and  will be from among the people of *Jannah.* This Surah should,  however, under no circumstance be written and kept in the house or  garden as it may have harmful effects. Imam Sadiq (a.s.) has said that  if kept in a house or garden, it will soon be destroyed. Indeed this is a weapon that one is only allowed to use against an evil person who is  the enemy of Islam.

If a person recites the last verse of Surah al-Kahf before sleeping at night, Allah (S.w.T.) creates a *noor* (light) from his sleeping place up to the Holy Ka’bah and in this light are angels who continually pray for the reciter until he wakes up.

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) that if a person  wishes to wake up at a particular time, he should recite the last *ayah* of this Surah and then make the intention that he will wake up at a  certain time and he will wake up at that time. He (a.s.) also said that  if a person recites this Surah every Thursday night, he will die the  death of a martyr. Keeping this Surah (written) in the house becomes a  means of protection from poverty and debts.

Keeping this Surah (written) in the house ensures protection from  thieves and Allah (S.w.T.) blesses the occupants of the house. It is  also narrated that before going in the presence of a tyrant ruler, if a  person recites *‘Kaf-Ha-Ya-’Ain-Saad’* and closed, with each letter, one finger of his right hand, and then recites *‘Ha-Mim-‘Ain-Seen-Qaaf’* and with each letter, closes one finger of his left hand; and then he comes in the presence of the tyrant and recites *‘wa ‘anatil wujuhu lil hayyil qayyum wa khaaba man hamala dhulma’* and then he opens his fingers, he will be protected from the evil of the tyrant.

This Surah should be recited before war, going before a tyrant ruler  and trying to guide a community towards the path of Allah (S.w.T.). If a girl is not getting married and she wishes to get married, she should  take *ghusl* (bath) with water in which this Surah has been dissolved and by the will of Allah (S.w.T.) she will get married.

If a man wishes to get married, he should write verses 131 and 132 of this Surah with *saffron* and then wear it as a talisman and *InshaAllah* his proposal will be accepted.
