### How Django Websites Work

####  Introduction:

In this tutorial, we are going to discuss the working of Django  websites. In order to acquire a firm grip over various Django concepts,  it is essential to know how a website is served to a client. Let's start our discussion with the client and the server.

#### What Is A Client?

- Computer hardware or software device that can make requests.
- The client accesses the web pages made available by the server.

#### What Is A Server?

- A physical computer that is responsible for running services to fulfill the requirements of the other computers(clients).

- Example: A shared hosting, VPS, etc. (More on hosting and servers later)

  

####  What Is A Website?

A website is nothing but a combination of HTML (Hypertext Markup  Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript. But, we need a  back-end system like Django, Flask, PHP, etc., to make sure that the  front-end of a website is served as per the user's request.

#### Why We Are Using Python?

Python is an amazing scripting language that is capable of doing much more than building logic. It will be super easy for us to use Python's  machine learning and data science libraries on our websites if we use  Python as our back-end.
We use HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front-end development, while Python is used for back-end development.

#### Difference Between front-end and back-end:

##### Front-End:

- It is a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Users can directly view and interact with this data.
- It is also referred to as client-side or front-end design.

##### Back-end:

- Back-end takes care of when and which webpage should be visible to the client corresponding to a given request.
- Users can not directly view or interact with this data. The back-end is all about the behind-the-scene activities.
- It is also referred to as the server-side.

#### What Is A Web Browser?

- A software application that allows us to access information on the World Wide Web.
- The browser takes raw HTML, CSS, and Javascript from a web server and then displays a web page on the screen.

With this, we have completed our discussion on the working of a  website and the purpose of using Python while building a website. I hope all the concepts that we have discussed in this blog are crystal clear  to you.

Please drop a comment in the QnA if you have any queries. It would be my pleasure to help you!

#### What is the path function?

- Path function is contained within the django.urls module.
- It helps in routing URLs to the appropriate view function within a Django project.

#### What Is Bootstrap?

- Bootstrap is a front-end development framework.
- It is a library of HTML, CSS, and JS used to create modern websites and web applications.

#### Django Apps :

- Apps in Django are pluggable web applications.
- Django apps are the self-sufficient submodule of a project. A  project can contain more than one apps, and an app can be used in more  than more one project.
